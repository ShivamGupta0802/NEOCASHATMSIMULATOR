# **NeoCash ATM System**

NeoCash ATM System is a Java-based desktop application that simulates basic ATM operations. It allows users to create accounts, log in using a 4-digit PIN, check their balance, deposit and withdraw money, and view recent transactions. The interface is built with Swing and features a simple dark-theme design. All account data and transaction history are saved automatically using Java file serialization, so information is retained even after the program closes.
